! File: main42.cmnd
! This file contains commands to be read in for a Pythia8 run. 
! Lines not beginning with a letter or digit are comments.
! Names are case-insensitive  -  but spellings-sensitive!
! The changes here are illustrative, not always physics-motivated.

! 1) Settings that will be used in a main program.
Main:numberOfEvents = 100000       ! number of events to generate
Main:timesAllowErrors = 30000          ! abort run after this many flawed events

! 2) Settings related to output in init(), next() and stat().
Init:showChangedSettings = on      ! list changed settings
Init:showAllSettings = off         ! list all settings
Init:showChangedParticleData = on  ! list changed particle data
Init:showAllParticleData = off     ! list all particle data
Next:numberCount = 10000            ! print message every n events
Next:numberShowLHA = 0             ! print LHA information n times
Next:numberShowInfo = 0            ! print event information n times
Next:numberShowProcess = 0         ! print process record n times
Next:numberShowEvent = 0           ! print event record n times
Stat:showPartonLevel = off          ! additional statistics on MPI

! 3) Beam parameter settings. Values below agree with default ones.
Beams:idA = 2212                   ! first beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:idB = 2212                   ! second beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:eCM = 14000.                 ! CM energy of collision

! 4a) Pick processes and kinematics cuts.
HiggsSM:ff2Hff(t:ZZ) = on
HiggsSM:ff2Hff(t:WW) = on
25:onMode=off
25:onIfAny = 13
25:m0 = 125.0

! 4b) Alternative beam and process selection from a Les Houches Event File.
! NOTE: to use this option, comment out the lines in section 4a above
! and uncomment the ones below. Section 3 is ignored for frameType = 4.
#Beams:frameType = 4                ! read info from a LHEF
#Beams:LHEF = ttbar.lhe             ! the LHEF to read from

! 5) Other settings. Can be expanded as desired. 
! Note: may overwrite some of the values above, so watch out.
#Tune:pp = 6                        ! use Tune 4Cx
#ParticleDecays:limitTau0 = on      ! set long-lived particle stable ...
#ParticleDecays:tau0Max = 10        ! ... if c*tau0 > 10 mm
